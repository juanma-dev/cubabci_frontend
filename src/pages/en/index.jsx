                    My name is Juan Manuel Castellanos Hernández, and I am a Cuban and Spanish citizen. I was born in Cienfuegos and lived in Cuba until I was 33 years old. Currently, I am 36 years old and I live in Barcelona, Spain.<br /><br />

                    I want to publicly denounce the use of military technology by the tyrannical communist regime in Cuba, which is being used against the Cuban people. This is the BCI (Brain-Computer Interface), a technology that allows direct control of a person's brain. With this technology, it is possible to manipulate all aspects of brain function, from inputting thoughts to controlling physical movements, all wirelessly.<br /><br />

                    Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are systems that establish direct communication between the brain and a computer. While similar civilian technologies exist, such as <a href="https://neuralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuralink</a>, I do not know the specific technical details of the military version used by the communists in Cuba. It is important to note that military technology usually has a considerable advance compared to civilian technology, with development periods that can span years and even decades.<br /><br />

                    My statement is based on my personal experience: I was connected to this technology in Cuba in 2021 and continue to be so to this day. I have been subjected to torture using this technology, including the constant bombardment of my brain with messages and thoughts. I have been deprived of sleep and all my senses have been attacked, in addition to controlling my body and causing me intense physical pain.<br /><br />

                    Cuba is on the list of “terrorist-sponsoring” countries of the United States of America. The Cuban regime has committed systematic human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, abusive criminal proceedings and torture. They have murdered opponents and sunk boats. The purpose of this technology is clear: control the Cuban population, quell any attempt at a popular uprising in search of freedom and, with impunity, torture those who oppose the regime.<br /><br />

                    I have gone to the hospital in an attempt to use the BCI as evidence to show the world what is happening in my brain and obtain evidence of the torture I have been subjected to. It is a perfect alibi, but I still make the complaint in the hope that some intelligence agency will support my testimony, since I know that they are aware of the existence of this technology and the abuses that are being committed with it.<br /><br />

                    Viva Cuba Libre.<br /><br />
